            <p>
            My name is Lawson Vanderpool, I am currently enrolled in a U of A coding bootcamp to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a variety of other related web development skills. 
            I have been a tech nerd all my life and after spending several years in the restaurant industry, I have decided to make the leap into pursuing my passion and learning to 
            code once and for all. Below you will find a list of links to some of my earlier works, as well as a contact form and a link to my resume.
